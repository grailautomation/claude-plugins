# Connectors

## How tool references work

Plugin files use `~~category` as a placeholder for whatever tool the user connects in that category. For example, `~~project tracker` might mean Asana, Linear, Jira, or any other project tracker with a CLI or MCP source.

Plugins are **tool-agnostic** — they describe workflows in terms of categories (chat, project tracker, knowledge base, etc.) rather than specific products. The `.mcp.json` pre-configures fallback MCP servers, but any maintained CLI or MCP source in that category works when it follows the CLI-first policy below.

## CLI-first integration policy

Prefer a maintained CLI over MCP whenever the CLI can safely perform the
workflow. Use `gws gmail`, `gws calendar`, `gws drive`, or `gws docs` for Google
Workspace after checking `gws auth status`. Use MCP when no usable CLI exists,
the CLI cannot express the operation safely, or the workflow depends on
MCP-only capabilities.
